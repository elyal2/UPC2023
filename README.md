* Lesson 1: *Time Series Forecasting with Pandas and Prophet.*
Time series forecasting is a method used to predict future events or values by analyzing trends and patterns in the data collected over time. A time series is a sequence of data points that are typically collected or recorded at regular time intervals. Common examples include daily stock market prices, monthly electricity consumption, yearly sales figures, and so on. Time series analysis is crucial for understanding trends, forecasting future values, and making data-driven decisions.

* Lesson 2: *Examples of NLP Tasks.*
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. It involves the creation of computational algorithms to process and understand human language. NLP has many challenges due to the complexity and nuance of human language, including ambiguity, sarcasm, idioms, and the need for context understanding.

* Lesson 3: *Logistics Accident Prevention System.*
Computer vision, blending machine learning and image processing, has significantly evolved, creating groundbreaking applications in various sectors. This field allows machines to interpret and understand visual data, leading to numerous innovative use cases. Letâ€™s explore some common applications and the key libraries and frameworks that drive these developments.
